# Project 14

This is a repo to hold the code for the final project for Schreiber's AP Comp
Sci class. This is a text based adventure game (kinda stupid, but cool)

## Compiling

There are two ways to compile

1. Bluej
    Just add all of the .java files to a bluej project and hit compile. Then
    you can start the main method in the Main class to run the game.

2. Terminal
    ```sh
    javac *.java
    java Main
    ```
